# Message Duplication Fix - COMPLETE ✅

## Problem Statement

User reported: "the response still always show duplications" in the Textual UI.

Previous fix attempts by Codex failed. This document describes the successful root cause fix.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Duplication Flow

The duplication occurred due to TWO separate rendering paths for assistant messages:

1. **Console Output Path** (DUPLICATE SOURCE):
   - `TaskProgressDisplay.print_final_status()` prints assistant message to console
   - Console bridge (`bridge_print`) captures ALL console output
   - Captured output is enqueued via `_enqueue_console_text()`
   - Console output is rendered to UI

2. **Session Message Path** (CORRECT SOURCE):
   - Assistant message is stored in `session.messages`
   - `_render_responses()` renders messages from session
   - Messages are rendered to UI

**Result**: The same assistant message appeared TWICE - once from console output, once from session.

### Why Previous Fixes Failed

1. **Deduplication in ConversationLog**: Added normalization and comparison, but timing issue:
   - Console output is enqueued BEFORE session message is rendered
   - At enqueue time, `_last_assistant_normalized` is not yet set
   - Deduplication check fails, console output is rendered
   - Session message is then rendered
   - Result: Both render, appearing as duplicates

2. **Console capture in _run_query**: Removed explicit capture, but:
   - Console bridge was still active
   - All console.print() calls automatically captured
   - Console output still enqueued

## The Fix

### Solution: Disable Console Bridge During Query Processing

**File**: `/Users/quocnghi/codes/swe-cli/swecli/ui_textual/runner.py`

**What Changed**:

In `_run_query()` method (lines 132-168):

```python
def _run_query(self, message: str) -> list[ChatMessage]:
    """Execute a user query via the REPL and return new session messages."""
    import traceback

    session = self.session_manager.get_current_session()
    previous_count = len(session.messages) if session else 0

    try:
        # Temporarily disable console bridge to prevent duplicate rendering
        # All relevant messages are already in session.messages
        console = self.repl.console
        original_print = console.print
        original_log = getattr(console, "log", None)

        # Restore original print/log functions (bypass bridge)
        console.print = self._original_console_print
        if original_log and self._original_console_log:
            console.log = self._original_console_log

        try:
            self.repl._process_query(message)
        finally:
            # Restore bridge
            console.print = original_print
            if original_log:
                console.log = original_log

        session = self.session_manager.get_current_session()
        if not session:
            return []

        new_messages = session.messages[previous_count:]
        return new_messages
    except Exception as e:
        error_msg = f"[ERROR] Query processing failed: {str(e)}\n{traceback.format_exc()}"
        self._enqueue_console_text(error_msg)
        return []
```

**Key Points**:

1. **Temporarily disables console bridge**: Restores original console.print/log functions
2. **Processes query without capture**: All console output goes to terminal, NOT to UI
3. **Restores bridge after**: Ensures bridge is restored for other operations
4. **Only session messages are rendered**: Single source of truth for UI rendering

### Additional Cleanup

Removed debug logging from:
- `/Users/quocnghi/codes/swe-cli/swecli/ui_textual/runner.py` (lines 167-175)
- `/Users/quocnghi/codes/swe-cli/swecli/ui_textual/chat_app.py` (lines 55-66)

## Verification

### Automated Tests

Created comprehensive test suite in `/Users/quocnghi/codes/swe-cli/test_final_verification.py`:

**Test Results** (all passing ✅):

```
[Test 1] Verifying console output is not captured...
  ✓ Console texts enqueued during query: 0
  ✅ PASS: No console output captured (duplication prevented!)

[Test 2] Verifying session message count...
  ✓ User messages: 1
  ✓ Assistant messages: 1
  ✅ PASS: Exactly 1 assistant message in session

[Test 3] Verifying rendering doesn't duplicate...
  ✓ Messages to be rendered: 1
  ✅ PASS: Only 1 message will be rendered
```

### What Was Fixed

✅ **Console output is no longer captured during query processing**
- The console bridge is temporarily disabled
- Console output goes to terminal only, not to UI

✅ **Only session messages are rendered to the UI**
- Single source of truth: `session.messages`
- No duplicate rendering paths

✅ **Assistant messages appear exactly ONCE**
- No more duplication
- Clean, single-render flow

## Testing the Fix

### Run Automated Tests

```bash
python test_final_verification.py
```

Expected output:
```
🎉 SUCCESS: Duplication issue is FIXED!

What was fixed:
  • Console output is no longer captured during query processing
  • Only session messages are rendered to the UI
  • Assistant messages appear exactly ONCE
```

### Manual Testing

1. Start the Textual UI:
   ```bash
   swecli-textual
   ```

2. Type any query (e.g., "hello")

3. Press Enter

4. **Expected behavior**: Assistant response appears ONCE

5. **Previous behavior**: Assistant response appeared TWICE

## Technical Details

### Why Console Output Still Prints

You'll notice that during automated tests, the assistant message is still printed to stdout:

```
⏺ Hello! I'm SWE-CLI, your AI assistant...
⏺ completed in 4s, ↑ 5.6k tokens
```

This is **expected and correct**:
- Console output still goes to the terminal (for debugging/logging)
- But it's NOT captured and rendered to the Textual UI
- Only session messages are rendered to the UI

In the actual Textual UI:
- The terminal output is hidden (you're inside the TUI)
- Only the single session message is displayed
- No duplication visible

### Console Bridge Behavior

The console bridge is still active for:
- Slash commands (`/sessions`, `/mode`, etc.)
- Error messages
- Other console operations

It's only temporarily disabled during:
- Query processing (`_run_query`)

This ensures:
- Commands can still capture and display console output
- Queries only render session messages (no duplication)

## Files Modified

   - Modified `_run_query()` to disable console bridge during query processing

## Summary

### The Fix in One Sentence

**Temporarily disable the console bridge during query processing so that assistant messages are only rendered from session data, eliminating duplicate rendering.**

### Before Fix

```
User: hello
│
├─> Query Processing
│   ├─> TaskProgressDisplay prints to console
│   │   └─> Console bridge captures it
│   │       └─> Enqueued for UI rendering (1st render)
│   └─> Message stored in session
│
└─> Render session messages
    └─> Assistant message rendered (2nd render)

Result: DUPLICATE ❌
```

### After Fix

```
User: hello
│
├─> Query Processing
│   ├─> Console bridge DISABLED
│   ├─> TaskProgressDisplay prints to terminal (not captured)
│   └─> Message stored in session
│
└─> Render session messages
    └─> Assistant message rendered (ONLY render)

Result: NO DUPLICATE ✅
```
