# Message Duplication Fix - Summary for User

## Status: ‚úÖ FIXED AND VERIFIED

The message duplication issue in the Textual UI has been **completely fixed** and verified with automated tests.

## What Was the Problem?

Assistant messages were appearing **twice** in the Textual UI because:

1. **Console output path**: TaskProgressDisplay printed messages to console ‚Üí console bridge captured them ‚Üí rendered to UI
2. **Session message path**: Messages stored in session ‚Üí rendered to UI

Result: Same message rendered twice

## The Solution

**Disabled the console bridge during query processing** so that:
- Console output goes to terminal only (not captured)
- Only session messages are rendered to UI
- Single source of truth = no duplication

## Verification

All automated tests pass:

```bash
$ python test_final_verification.py

‚úÖ Console output not captured
‚úÖ Session has 1 assistant message
‚úÖ Rendering won't duplicate

üéâ SUCCESS: Duplication issue is FIXED!
```

## How to Test

### Option 1: Run Automated Tests

```bash
python test_final_verification.py
```

Expected: All tests pass with "üéâ SUCCESS"

### Option 2: Manual Testing

```bash
swecli-textual
```

Then type any query (e.g., "hello") and press Enter.

**Expected**: Assistant response appears **ONCE** (no duplication)

## Files Changed

### Modified:
- `swecli/ui_textual/runner.py` - Disabled console bridge during query processing
- `swecli/ui_textual/chat_app.py` - Cleaned up debug logging

### Created:
- `test_final_verification.py` - Comprehensive automated tests
- `DUPLICATION_FIX_COMPLETE.md` - Full technical documentation

## Technical Details

The fix works by temporarily bypassing the console bridge during query processing:

```python
# Disable bridge
console.print = self._original_console_print

# Process query (console output NOT captured)
self.repl._process_query(message)

# Restore bridge
console.print = original_print
```

This ensures:
- Console output is NOT captured/rendered to UI
- Only session messages are rendered
- No duplication possible

## Quick Verification Command

```bash
# Run test and verify all pass
python test_final_verification.py && echo "‚úÖ Fix verified!"
```

## What You'll See

Before the fix:
```
User: hello
Assistant: Hello! I'm SWE-CLI...
Assistant: Hello! I'm SWE-CLI...  ‚Üê DUPLICATE
```

After the fix:
```
User: hello
Assistant: Hello! I'm SWE-CLI...  ‚Üê ONLY ONCE
```

**The duplication issue is completely resolved and ready for use.**
