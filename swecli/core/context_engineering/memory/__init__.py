"""Long-term memory and learning for SWE-CLI (ACE Pattern).

This module provides a complete native re-implementation of the ACE framework
within swecli, without external dependencies.

ACE Components:
    - Playbook: Structured storage for learned strategies (Bullet objects)
    - Generator: Produces answers using playbook strategies
    - Reflector: Analyzes execution outcomes (LLM-powered)
    - Curator: Evolves playbook through delta operations
    - Delta operations: ADD, UPDATE, TAG, REMOVE mutations

Based on: Agentic Context Engine (ACE)
