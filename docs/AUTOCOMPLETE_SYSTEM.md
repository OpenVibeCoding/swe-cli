# ✅ Autocomplete System - Complete!

## 🎉 What Was Implemented

Successfully implemented a Claude Code-style autocomplete system with:
- **@ File Mentions**: Autocomplete file paths with dropdown
- **/ Slash Commands**: Autocomplete commands with descriptions
- **Real-time Filtering**: Filter as you type
- **Smart File Search**: Excludes common directories (node_modules, .git, etc.)

---

## 🚀 Features

### 1. **File Mention Autocomplete (@)**

Type `@` followed by a file name to get autocomplete suggestions:

```
[NORMAL] > @test
```

**Dropdown shows:**
```
test_autocomplete.py           - file
test_approval_flow.py          - file
test_complex_task.py           - file
test_custom_agent.py           - file
test_init_command.py           - file
...
```

**Features:**
- Shows up to 50 matching files
- Searches recursively through working directory
- Filters as you type (`@test` shows only files with "test")
- Excludes common directories (.git, node_modules, __pycache__, etc.)
- Relative paths from working directory
- Press **Tab** or **→** to complete
- Press **↑/↓** to navigate options

---

### 2. **Slash Command Autocomplete (/)**

Type `/` to see all available commands:

```
[NORMAL] > /
```

**Dropdown shows:**
```
/model      - choose what model and reasoning effort to use
/approvals  - choose what SWE-CLI can do without approval
/review     - review my current changes and find issues
/new        - start a new chat during a conversation
/init       - create an AGENTS.md file with instructions
/compact    - summarize conversation to prevent hitting the context limit
/diff       - show git diff (including untracked files)
/mention    - mention a file
/help       - show available commands and help
/exit       - exit SWE-CLI
...
```

**Features:**
- 17 built-in commands (similar to Claude Code)
- Filters as you type (`/mod` shows `/model`)
- Shows command descriptions in dropdown
- Press **Tab** or **→** to complete
- Press **↑/↓** to navigate options

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Architecture

**Autocomplete Module** (`swecli/ui/autocomplete.py`):
```python
class SWE-CLICompleter(Completer):
    """Custom completer for @ mentions and / commands."""

    def get_completions(self, document, complete_event):
        # Detect @ or / trigger
        match = re.search(r'([@/])([^\s@/]*)$', text)

        if trigger == "/":
            # Slash command completion
            yield from self._get_slash_command_completions(word)

        elif trigger == "@":
            # File mention completion
            yield from self._get_file_mention_completions(word)
```

**REPL Integration** (`swecli/repl/repl.py`):
```python
# Create autocomplete for @ mentions and / commands
self.completer = SWE-CLICompleter(working_dir=self.config_manager.working_dir)

self.prompt_session = PromptSession(
    history=FileHistory(str(history_file)),
    completer=self.completer,
    complete_while_typing=True,  # Real-time completion
)
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### Interactive Testing

   ```bash
   swecli
   ```

2. **Try Slash Commands:**
   ```
   [NORMAL] > /
   ```
   - Press **Tab** to see all commands
   - Type `/mod` and press **Tab** to complete to `/model`
   - Use **↑/↓** to navigate, **Enter** to select

3. **Try File Mentions:**
   ```
   [NORMAL] > @
   ```

   - Type `@test` and press **Tab** to filter
   - Use **↑/↓** to navigate, **Enter** to select

4. **Example Usage:**
   ```
   [NORMAL] > @setup.py contains the package configuration
   [NORMAL] > /model to switch models
   ```

## 🔍 Smart Features

### 1. **Context-Aware Completion**
Works anywhere in the input:
```
hello world @                 ← Completes files
hello world /                 ← Completes commands
```

### 2. **Real-time Filtering**
Narrows down results as you type:
```
@test         → Shows all files with "test"
@test_a       → Shows only files matching "test_a"
/mod          → Shows only /model command
```

### 3. **Excluded Directories**
Automatically excludes common directories:
- `.git`, `.hg`, `.svn` (version control)
- `__pycache__`, `.pytest_cache`, `.mypy_cache` (Python)
- `node_modules` (Node.js)
- `.venv`, `venv` (virtual environments)
- `dist`, `build`, `.eggs` (build artifacts)

### 4. **Sorted Results**
- Shorter paths appear first
- Alphabetically sorted
- Up to 50 results maximum (performance)

## 🎨 Visual Examples

### Before (No Autocomplete):
```
[NORMAL] > /mod
           ^^^^
           Not sure if this command exists?
```

### After (With Autocomplete):
```
[NORMAL] > /mod█

╭─────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ /model - choose what model to use              │
│ /mention - mention a file                      │
╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

Press Tab or → to complete
Press ↑/↓ to navigate
```

## 💡 Usage Tips

1. **Quick File Reference:**
   ```
   Can you update @swecli/repl/repl.py to add a new feature?
   ```

2. **Command Discovery:**
   ```
   Type / and press Tab to see all available commands
   ```

3. **Partial Matching:**
   ```
   @test          → Shows all test files
   @test_auto     → Narrows to test_auto* files
   ```

4. **Multiple Mentions:**
   ```
   Compare @file1.py with @file2.py and refactor common code
   ```

---

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Custom Commands

To add custom slash commands, edit `swecli/ui/autocomplete.py`:

```python
SLASH_COMMANDS = [
    SlashCommand("mycommand", "description of my command"),
    # ... existing commands
]
```

### Adjust Max Results

Change `max_results` parameter in `_find_files()`:

```python
def _find_files(self, query: str, max_results: int = 50):
    # Increase to 100 for more results
    matches = []
    # ...
```

### Exclude Additional Directories

Add to `exclude_dirs` set:

```python
exclude_dirs = {
    ".git",
    "node_modules",
    "my_custom_dir",  # Add your directory
    # ...
}
```

---

## 📝 Implementation Details

### Completer Classes

**SWE-CLICompleter** - Main completer (handles both @ and /):
```python
completer = SWE-CLICompleter(working_dir=Path.cwd())
```

**FileMentionCompleter** - File mentions only:
```python
completer = FileMentionCompleter(working_dir=Path.cwd())
```

**SlashCommandCompleter** - Slash commands only:
```python
completer = SlashCommandCompleter(commands=SLASH_COMMANDS)
```

### Prompt Toolkit Integration

Uses `prompt_toolkit.completion.Completer` interface:
- `get_completions()` - Returns completion objects
- `Completion()` - Represents a single completion
  - `text` - The completion text
  - `start_position` - Where to insert (negative offset from cursor)
  - `display` - What to show in dropdown
  - `display_meta` - Description/metadata

---

## 🎯 Performance

- **Fast File Search**: Uses `os.walk()` with early termination
- **Efficient Filtering**: Regex-based pattern matching
- **Limited Results**: Maximum 50 files to prevent slowdown
- **Smart Exclusions**: Skips directories that would slow down search
- **Memory Efficient**: Generates completions on-demand (yield)

---
