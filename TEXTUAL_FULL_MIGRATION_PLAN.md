# Textual UI Migration Master Plan

## Purpose
Provide a structured roadmap for migrating SWE-CLI's interactive experience from the legacy `prompt_toolkit` implementation to the new Textual interface while keeping both paths available during the transition.

## Guiding Principles
- **Parity first**: reach feature parity with the current CLI before switching defaults.
- **Parallel paths**: ship the Textual experience behind its own entry point (`swecli-textual` / `swecli run textual`) to avoid disrupting existing users.
- **Incremental integration**: reuse existing service layers (REPL, runtime, tool execution) instead of re-implementing logic inside the UI.
- **Observability**: add logging, metrics, and toggle flags to monitor Textual adoption during beta.
- **Documentation**: keep this plan updated as milestones ship; log decisions + regressions.

## Current Status (March 2025)
- ✅ Textual POC stabilized (`ChatTextArea` multi-line, history, paste, formatting).
- ✅ Unit coverage for history & paste flows.
- ✅ **Integration with core SWE-CLI runtime fully wired** (`TextualRunner` implemented).
- ✅ **CLI command available**: `swecli-textual` launches Textual UI with full tool calling support.
- ✅ Approval modal integrated for command approvals.
- ✅ Console output bridging (REPL → Textual conversation log).
- ⚙️ Tool progress streaming (spinners) - pending enhancement.
- ⚙️ Syntax-highlighted tool outputs - pending enhancement.

## Phase Breakdown

| Phase | Goal | Key Tasks | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **P0 – Stabilize POC** | Harden Textual chat experience | Multiline, history, paste, formatting, docs | ✅ Done |
| **P1 – Runtime Integration** | Drive Textual UI via core REPL/runtime | Create Textual runner, bridge message pipeline, ensure tool outputs render | ✅ **Done** |
| **P2 – Feature Parity** | Match prompt_toolkit feature set | Mode switching, approvals, tool streaming, status bar data | 🚧 In progress |
| **P3 – Beta Launch** | Ship opt-in CLI entry point | Add `swecli-textual` script, telemetry, docs | 🚧 Partially done |
| **P4 – Default Cutover** | Make Textual default once stable | Deprecate prompt_toolkit UI, migration comms | ⬜ Pending |

## Detailed Task Backlog

### P1 – Runtime Integration (Target: early April 2025)
- [x] **Create runner module** (`swecli/ui_textual/runner.py`) exposing `launch_textual_cli(config)`.
  - [x] Scaffold module with placeholder handler (initial commit).
  - [x] Wire configuration loading (reuse `ConfigManager`).
  - [x] Instantiate shared services (SessionManager + REPL bootstrap).
- [x] **Message processing bridge**
  - [x] Translate `ChatTextArea` submissions into `ChatMessage` objects (session-backed).
  - [x] Route through REPL `_process_query` synchronously (initial pass).
  - [x] Mirror REPL console output into Textual conversation log (commands + results).
  - [ ] Stream live tool progress (spinners/partial output) into Textual widgets.
- [x] **Tool + approval UX**
  - [x] Surface approval prompts in Textual (modal with edit/approve options).
  - [ ] Render tool outputs with syntax highlighting / structured panels.
- [x] **Event loop alignment**
  - [x] Ensure Textual async tasks coexist with runtime (asyncio loop wrapper implemented).
  - [ ] Add graceful shutdown hooks syncing with `SessionManager`.

### P2 – Feature Parity
- [ ] Mode switching (PLAN/NORMAL) with status bar cues.
- [ ] Session persistence (load/resume transcripts, attach to history ring).
- [ ] Config modal parity (edit model/config from UI).
- [ ] Advanced shortcuts (approvals, undo, quick commands).
- [ ] Transcript export / copy support.

### P3 – Beta Launch
- [x] CLI wiring:
  - [x] Add `swecli-textual` console script in `pyproject.toml`.
  - [x] Add textual dependency (>=0.60.0).
  - [ ] Add `swecli run textual` subcommand gating to new runner (optional).
  - [ ] Feature flag env var (`SWECLI_USE_TEXTUAL=1`) for power users (optional).
- [ ] QA matrix across macOS/Linux/Windows terminals.
- [ ] Documentation updates (README, docs/ui/textual.md).
- [ ] Release notes + migration guide.

### P4 – Default Cutover (Post-beta)
- [ ] Performance tuning + memory profiling.
- [ ] Accessibility review (screen readers, theme contrast).
- [ ] Remove prompt_toolkit dependencies once adoption target met.
- [ ] Announce deprecation timeline.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Async complexity**: Textual event loop + existing async tool processing. → Prototype integration in isolation, add integration tests.
- **Terminal compatibility**: Key handling differs across terminals. → Expand manual regression matrix, support configurable bindings.
- **Large tool outputs**: Ensure streaming output doesn’t block UI. → Use Textual background tasks, chunk outputs.
- **User adoption**: Provide opt-in period with clear documentation and rollback instructions.

## Milestone Tracking
- P0 ✅ – March 25, 2025
- P1 ⏳ – target early April 2025
- P2 ⏳ – target mid April 2025
- P3 ⏳ – target late April 2025
- P4 ⏳ – TBD (based on beta feedback)

## Immediate Next Steps
1. ✅ ~~Implement configuration + runtime wiring inside `swecli/ui_textual/runner.py`~~ - DONE
2. ✅ ~~Add async message bridge that invokes existing REPL tooling~~ - DONE
3. ✅ ~~Create command scaffold (`swecli-textual`)~~ - DONE
4. **Test the full integration**: Run `swecli-textual` and verify:
   - Chat works
   - Tool calling works
   - Approval modals appear correctly
   - Console output appears in conversation
5. **Enhance tool output rendering**: Add syntax highlighting and structured panels for tool results
6. **Implement tool progress streaming**: Show live spinners/progress during tool execution
7. Expand automated tests to cover runner bootstrapping (unit + smoke)
8. Update this plan weekly; log blockers and decision notes at the bottom of the file
